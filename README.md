# Intracompany-Dictionary-for-Engineering


As the leader in global E2E payments solutions, it is no secret that we have a vast, comprehensive list of products actively supported.
To help with this, we have over 100 new hires joining the #iNCRedible experience here at NCR Corp every year.

Unfortunately, the liberal usage of technical jargon and product specific acronyms can be a deterrent to meeting participation and solution interaction in the first months.
This also provides a challenge in getting oriented with a new product and/or documentation for more experienced software engineers as well.

IDE - the Intracompany Dictionary for Engineering, is a text editor extension in order to help our new hires grow and flourish even faster.

We can save months of onboarding and growing pains by accumulating a list of common (and not-so-common) product specific acronyms and packing it all into the extension.
When a new hire encounters a strange acronym in the code comment or method, they can simply hover over the section, and there will be a definition provided by the more experienced engineers!

We all stand on the shoulders of giants, so of course, we would want to expand to potentially create a 'definition submission' section, where users can create and submit definition suggestions for currently un-documented acronyms.
